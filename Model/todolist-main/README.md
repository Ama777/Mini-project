# todolist
A simple todo list app built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You can add and delete task and there respective descriptions so that you can plan your day !!!

When you open the folder, you'll find all the files needed to get started, the CSS code,the HTML file and javascript code.

the to-do list  has a beautiful UI, the user can add a to-do by filling the input and hit add-item button, after that he can rather check the to-do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.
